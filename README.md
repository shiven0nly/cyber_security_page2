# ICEN Web üíª (just open ICENWEB.html after extracting)

**ICEN** is a visually engaging, modern web project designed to showcase a fictional cyber security site. Built with a focus on creativity, user experience, and animation, this project is part of my personal learning journey in web development using **HTML** , **CSS** and **Javascript** :: and M "WORKING TO MAKE IT RESPONSIVE"

## üêû things to keep in mind
- If u click on learn more button on ICENWEB.html , then a paragraph box will generate and its , buggy because if u open too late or too early u will stuck then **just reload again**! (**if anyone has solution then please solve it!**)
- Now, when u click on Login a new page will generate , it wont store ur data yet because no backend, just click on sign in , pop up generate and click 'OK' , it will redirect to u the other page , not now React now that's why i made multi page to showcase the HTML,CSS,JS project i made.. heh
